# üêß üõ°Ô∏è Linux Network Security Configuration Guide

[README en Espa√±ol](./README.es.md)

This repository contains network security configurations for Linux systems (Debian-based distributions) that help protect against various network attacks and improve system security.

## What is `99-network-security.conf`?

The `99-network-security.conf` file is a system configuration file that sets various kernel parameters to enhance network security. It contains carefully tuned settings divided into several sections, each addressing specific security concerns.

## Configuration Sections and Their Purpose

### 1. Anti-Spoofing and Route Filtering Protections

- **rp_filter**: Configures reverse path filtering to prevent IP spoofing attacks.
  - Set to mode 2 (loose) for better compatibility with VPNs and asymmetric routing.
  - Applies to both IPv4 and IPv6.

### 2. DoS and SYN Flood Protection

- **tcp_syncookies**: Enables protection against SYN flood attacks.
- **icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts**: Prevents Smurf attack/DoS attempts.
- **icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses**: Enhances privacy by ignoring suspicious ICMP errors.

### 3. ICMP Redirects and MITM Protection

- Disables ICMP redirects acceptance and sending to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Applies security measures for both IPv4 and IPv6.

### 4. Advanced Forwarding and Routing

- **ip_forward**: Disables IP forwarding to prevent the machine from acting as a router.
- Blocks source routing to prevent route manipulation by attackers.

### 5. Logging and Detection

- **log_martians**: Option to log invalid/spoofed packets for security monitoring.

### 6. TCP Optimizations and Anti-Fingerprinting

- **tcp_timestamps**: Can be disabled to reduce OS fingerprinting.
- Enables selective ACK, D-SACK, and FACK for efficient and secure network performance.

### 7. IPv6 Controls

- Options to disable IPv6 if not needed, reducing attack surface.

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

1. Open a terminal.

2. Create the configuration file with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-network-security.conf
   ```

   (You can use your preferred editor like vim or gedit with sudo)

3. Copy and Paste the contents of [`99-network-security.conf`](./99-network-security.conf), modify the configuration according to your needs.

4. Save and close the editor (in nano: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

5. Apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo sysctl --system
   ```

## üîç Verifying the Changes

You can verify the applied settings using either of these commands:

### Compact Version

```bash
sysctl -a | grep -E 'net\.ipv4\.conf\.(all|default)\.(rp_filter|accept_redirects|send_redirects|accept_source_route|log_martians)|net\.ipv4\.(tcp_syncookies|icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts|icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses|ip_forward|tcp_timestamps|tcp_sack|tcp_dsack|tcp_fack)|net\.ipv6\.conf\.(all|default)\.(rp_filter|accept_redirects|accept_source_route|disable_ipv6)'
```

### Detailed Version

```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter net.ipv6.conf.default.rp_filter net.ipv6.conf.all.rp_filter net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects net.ipv4.ip_forward net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps net.ipv4.tcp_sack net.ipv4.tcp_dsack net.ipv4.tcp_fack net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6
